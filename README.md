# VR Accessibility SDK
## Overview
The VR Accessibility SDK is a toolkit designed to make virtual reality experiences more accessible to users with visual impairments. It provides a set of tools and features that developers can integrate into their VR applications to improve accessibility and ensure that all users can enjoy their experiences.

## Features
* **Partial Vision Tool**: Allows users to target objects to bring up descriptive text menus.
* **Alt-Text Generation**: Allows developers to add alt-text descriptions to GameObjects via editor script; features both manual and automated editor tools.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Provide spoken feedback for text-based content to assist users with visual impairments.
* **Alt-Text Linting**: Checks for presence, completeness, and clarity among alt-text fields among GameObjects.

## Installation
### Manual Installation:
1. Download the Accessibility in VR Unity SDK from GitHub.
2. Insert the SDK package files into your Unity project:
    - a. Open project in Unity.
    - b. Right-click **/Packages** folder in lower menu's "Project" tab.
    - c. Select "Show in Explorer"
    - d. Add the **VR-Accessibility-SDK** folder to project's **/Packages** directory.

## Usage
* Use **'Tools'/'Add Accessible Field(s) to entire scene'** command in upper Unity menu bar to add appropriate fields to all GameObjects in scene.
* Use **'Tools'/'Check Alt-Text'** command in upper Unity menu bar to Alt-Text of all GameObjects in scene for completeness and redundancy.
    * It is recommended to clear the console between activations to avoid confusion.
* Use **'Tools'/'Remove Accessible Field(s) from entire scene'** command in upper Unity menu bar to remove all fields from all GameObjects in scene.
* Use **[RMB] -> 'Add Accessible Field(s)'** command to add fields to selected GameObject
* To use Partial Vision Tool in scene:
    1. Add an instance of the *Partial Vision Assistance* prefab tool to scene.
    2. Set input command for Partial Vision tool using Unity's Input System.
    3. Under *Partial Vision Assistance*'s *Partial Vis* script:
        - a. Select a Raycast Origin corresponding to the player's right-controller (recommended), or any other object.
        - b. Set an Input System button reference corresponding to the previously set input command.
    4. Under *Partial Vision Assistance*'s *Menu Manager* script:
        - a. Select a *'Head'* corresponding to the player's camera viewpoint (recommended), or any other object.
        - b. Set Input System *'Display'* and *'Hide'* references corresponding to the previously set input command, or any other desired Input System references.
* To use Text-to-Speech in scene:
    1. Use **'Oculus'/'Voice SDK'/'Get Started'** command in upper Unity menu bar to bring up Setup Window.
        - a. Select a language to use built-in-NLP.
        - b. Press **'Create'** and name file as desired.
    2. Use **'Assets'/'Create'/'Voice SDK'/'TTS'/'Add Default TTS Setup'** command in upper Unity menu bar to add TTS object in hierarchy.
    3. Expand **'TTS'** object and select **'TTSWitService'** object.
        - a. Ensure **'Configuration'** is set to Wit configuration file created in step 1.
        - b. Set **'Audio Type'** to *'WAV'*.
        - c. Optional: Set **'Disk Cache Location'** from *'Stream'* to *'Temporary'* to store prompt audio data for faster performance.
    4. Select **'Partial Vision Assistance'** object in hierarchy.
        - a. Check **'Speak After Menu Close'** to allow voice to continue speaking if floating menu is closed prematurely.
        - b. Set **'TTS Speaker'** option to *'TTS Speaker'* object in hierarchy under *'TTS'* object.

## Requirements
* Requires Unity version **2021.3.37f1**
* Unity's **'InputSystem'** and **'XR.Interaction'** modules must be installed to the scene in order for the Partial Vision Tool to function.
    * The modules can be installed by following these steps:
        1. Open the Unity Editor.
        2. Go to **Window > Package Manager**.
        3. In the Package Manager window, navigate to the **"Packages: ..."** drop down menu and select **"Unity Registry"**.
        4. Navigate to **"Input System"** or **"XR Interaction Toolkit"** package. (Or select the **'+'** in the top-left and select **"Add package by name"** and enter "com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit" for XR Interaction Toolkit)
        5. If the package is not installed, click on the "Install" button next to it to install it into the project.
* Oculus Voice SDK must be installed to the scene in order for the Text-to-Speech functionality to take effect.
